# Web Scrapping : To fetch Per Capita Income of every state of India




## Acknowledgements

 This project is a part of my internship task at Newbieron Technologies. 



## Drscription

This project includes the visualization of Per Capita income of every states in India. The whole income data has been scrapped from the Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_and_union_territories_by_GDP_per_capita) and shown within a Geographical Chart with the help of a choropleth map.


I made this whole script in jupyter notebook (Python 3).

Tools have been used so far are :

1. BeautifulSoup (To scrap the data from the web URL)

2. Pandas (To create data frame taking the scrapped data)

3. Matplotlib (To visualize the map)

## Result :

This map in below is clearly showing the Per Capita Income across whole India and ensuring the standard of living of each person in the country that is differentiated statewise. In order to take several actions to make a better economy, this map should help to make an overall aspect in which of the states, the development is needed in order to raise the wellness of economy.
